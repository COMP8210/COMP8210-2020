# Workshop Week 8 - Data Analytics in Python

In this workshop you will conduct some data analytics in Python using Pandas, Numpy, and Scikit-learn. 

## 1. Explore the Iris Data Set (15 minutes + 10 minutes discussion)

Run the notebook that we have covered in the lecture. Make sure that you understand all the contents. Answer the following questions:

1. What is the accuracy of the system when it is evaluated with the test set?
2. What is the accuracy of the system when it is evaluated with the **training** set? (you need to figure out how to do this)
3. What is the prediction of your system for the following samples of data?

| Sepal Length | Sepal Width | Petal Length | Petal Width |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4.3 | 3.0 | 1.1 | 0.1 |
| 6.5 | 3.2 | 5.1 | 2.1 |
| 5.8 | 2.6 | 4.0 | 1.2 |

## 2. Analyse Multiple Models (15 minutes + 10 minutes discussion)

Sklearn has multiple classifiers but the interface of each of them is the same. The following documentation page introduces sklearn classifiers.

* https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html

Using the above documentation as reference, apply the following models (all three are very popular). For each model, you need to train it using the training set and then test it using the test set. Report the accuracy of the test set for each model.

1. Decision tree classifier (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html#classification)
2. Multinomial Naive Bayes (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/naive_bayes.html#multinomial-naive-bayes)
3. Support Vector Classification (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html#classification)

## 3. Deploy the model (10 minutes + 10 minutes discussion)

Choose one of the models that you created in task 1 and exchange it with your peer (send the model by email, for example).

Load the model from your peer and run it in your machine. Compare the results with those of your peer. Do you obtain the same results or different results?

## 4. Digit Classification (30 minutes + 10 minutes discussion)

Another very popular data set for practice is CIFAR-10. This is an image classification task where the goal is to predict which digit the image represents. As with the iris data set, most machine learning platforms will include CIFAR-10 in their repertoire. sklearn is no different and there is even a tutorial of machine learning using this data set:

* https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html

Follow the tutorial and do the same tasks as above:
1. Implement a classifier that uses Support Vector Classification.
2. Try other classifiers.
3. Exchange the model of one of the classifiers with that of your peer. Compare results.

## 5. Optional tasks

If you want more challenges, try these:

1. Instead of using the CIFAR-10 data set included in `sklearn`, search the web for another copy of the cifar-10 data set, download it, and prepare it so that it can be used by your code of task 4.
2. Use other data sets. For example, look at the Kaggle data sets: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets

Incidentally, Kaggle also offers free self-paced courses on machine learning: https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview And, of course, you can try and participate in one of their competitions: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions
