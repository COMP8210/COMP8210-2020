# Workshop Week 7 - Python and Pandas

Much of the contents of the workshops from next weeks, and assignment 7, will use Python. In this workshop you will practice with online environments for running and testing Python notebooks. You will use these online environments to learn about pandas.

**Before attending the workshop, please revise the material from week 3 for a quick review of Python.**

## 2. Introduction to Pandas in kaggle - 1 hour

Pandas is probably the most popular Python library for the manipulation of tabular data. Pandas integrates well with Numpy, a Python library that is widely used for the manipulation of arrays. Pandas also offers simple and intuitive methods to filter and explore the data, and to produce visualisations.

The following course from kaggle.com introduces pandas. The course includes exercises that you can complete in notebooks that are run in Kaggle's cloud service.

Complete lessons 1 and 2, including their exercises.
* https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas

1. In lesson 1 you will learn to create Pandas tables, and to import CSV files into Pandas tables.

2. In lesson 2 you will learn to access different parts of a Pandas table.

Feel free to complete the remaining lessons at your leisure. In the following weeks of COMP8210 we will use some of the functionality introduced in the following lessons, especially for obtaining summaries and for visualisation.

### FYI - About Kaggle

Kaggle is a very popular site that runs data science competitions. This is a platform that I (Diego Molla) regularly use to run programming competitions in natural language processing. Check, for example, last year's competitions, or the one that I have just released:

* [ALTA 2020 Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/alta-2020-challenge/) - Assess Human Behaviour
* [ALTA 2019 Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/alta-2019-challenge/) - Sarcasm Target Identification
* [ALTA 2018 Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/alta-2018-challenge/) - Patent Application Classification

Besides running competitions, Kaggle offers data sets. Kaggle also has a cloud service that members can use to run Python notebooks using a browser.

## 3. Pandas tutorial in Google Colaboratory - 30 minutes

Google Colaboratory (aka Colab) allows anyone with a Google Drive account to run Python notebooks on the cloud. The following course is a notebook with another introduction to Pandas. Open the course in Google Colab and complete the exercises.
